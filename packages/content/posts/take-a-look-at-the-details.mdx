In the AI era, creating things is so easy that anyone can do it. It just takes a few words and, voila! You have a fully working application. This amazes me every day! I can't just think in the day, we all have our own apps, built by ourselves for ourselves. This is the engineering core getting to the masses. We can just create solutions for every problem we have using software and natural language, this is just incredible!

But anyway, to build things is so easy right now that to create valuable software, you'll need to take a look at the details and give amazing experiences back to the user.

In a world where everyone can solve their own problems with their own pieces of software, you'll need to be creative, and the value will come more from the way you impact people's lives than from solving the problem itself.

Things are changing, and they are changing fast. And this is a personal opinion, but we're all afraid of change. All the catastrophic futures people are posting about are only a reflection of themselves projected into their future.

I'm writing this post with a tool I built for myself 20 minutes ago using AI. I built the experience I wanted and how I needed. This can't just be the end of building, bro. I think I'm just starting to love doing this, and I can't wait see what incredible people like you, reading this, will build in the future!

For me, this will be a new chapter in my life. I want to write more, since there's going to be a lot of AI generated content writing becomes special again. I want to build, and I hope you do too. But please, don't forget to take a look at the details!
